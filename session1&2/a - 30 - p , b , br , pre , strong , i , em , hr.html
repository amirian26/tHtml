            Millipedes are a class (Diplopoda) of arthropods, characterised by two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments.
            Most species have long cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while pill millipedes are shorter and
            can roll into a ball. There are around 12,000 named species, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods. Despite their 
            name (from the Latin for "thousand feet"), no known species has 1,000 legs; the most recorded is 750. Most species are detritivores, 
            eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or 
            garden pests. Most defend themselves with a variety of chemicals secreted from pores along the body, except for the tiny bristle millipedes, 
            which are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. First appearing in the Silurian period, millipedes are some of the oldest known land animals.
            While the largest modern species can reach lengths of 38 cm (15 in),
